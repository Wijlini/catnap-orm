= Features =

 * Mapping via fluent interface (no auto mapping or attibute based mapping, but could be added)
 * Entities inherit from IEitity interface which exposes one property: int Id
 * Automatic loading of collections, lazy or eager, configurable per collection
 * Cascading deletes and saves, configurable per collection
 * Filtered collection mapping
 * Basic !UnitOfWork capability for session and transaction management
 * {{{Repository<T>}}} base class
 * Database migration feature -- tracks changes and applies updates (forward only)
 * !DbCommandSpec provides a way to create and execute any parameterized query (similar to IDbCommand)
 * Support for Linq predicates for finding (very limited)

= Configuration =

Something like this at startup:

{{{
SessionFactory.Initialize("MyDatabase.sqlite");
DomainMap.Configure
    (
    new EntityMap<Person>()
        .Property(x => x.Id)
        .Property(x => x.FirstName)
        .Property(x => x.LastName),
    new EntityMap<Forum>()
        .Property(x => x.Id)
        .List(x => x.Posts)
        .Property(x => x.Name),
    new EntityMap<Post>("ForumId")
        .Property(x => x.Id)
        .Property(x => x.Title)
        .Property(x => x.Body)
        .BelongsTo(x => x.Poster, "PosterId")
    );
using (UnitOfWork.Start())
{
    DatabaseMigrator.Execute();
}
}}}

= Usage =

== Get & Save ==

Here we will fetch a forum, change its title, remove a post, and add a post then save the forum.  The Posts collection will be loaded lazily.  The adds/deletes to Posts will be cascaded when the forum is saved.  A connection will be opened and closed, and the whole thing will be wrapped in a transaction.

{{{
using (UnitOfWork.Start())
{
   var person = personRepository.Get(1);
   var forum = forumRepository.Get(1);
   forum.Title = "Annoying Complaints";
   forum.RemovePost(forum.Posts[0]);
   forum.AddPost(new Post { Title = "Please help!", Body "Now!", Person = person });
   forumRepository.Save(forum);
}
}}}
